# 🎨 Vito Viktor – Awwwards Winning Homepage (Recreated)
A pixel-perfect rebuild of the Vito Viktor Awwwards-winning website — focusing purely on frontend design, micro-interactions, and smooth animations.

<br>

## 🧠 About the Project
This project is a frontend recreation of the awwward-winning Vito Viktor website.
The goal is to challenge my design-to-code accuracy, learn high-quality UI/UX implementation, and master advanced animation techniques used in modern web design.

I’m focusing only on the main homepage, replicating its layout, motion, and aesthetic as closely as possible.
